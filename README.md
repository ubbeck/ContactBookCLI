## Project Overview

Small command line project to practice the implementation and application of the Linked List data structure in C++ language. Some programming techniques included:

- **Linked Lists**: Implementing a custom linked list data structure from scratch.

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Applying OOP principles to create structured and modular code for the Contact Book.

- **Templates**: Utilizing C++ templates to build a flexible and reusable contact management system.

- **Dynamic Memory Management**: Learning about memory allocation and deallocation to handle contact data in a memory-efficient way.

- **Operator Overloading**: Demonstrating operator overloading techniques for enhanced code readability and usability.

- **Data Persistence**: Implementing data persistence by reading and writing contact information to an external file, allowing users to store and retrieve contacts between sessions.  

## Possible updates
- Replace external files with database
- Unit tests

## Build

The project has been developed in VSCode using the **MSVC** compiler.  
It has also been tested with the **MinGW** compiler version 12.2.0.  
The file `tracking_memory.h`, used to detect memory leaks, can be removed from the include headers if MSVC is not used.
